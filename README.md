# Understanding Linear Regression 

## Introduction

Here's the repository containing detailed explanation of linear regression using skicit learn, and also have performed EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) using pandas, numpy and seaborn.

## Code Samples

I have attached a full Colab file below to show what I have done in the Linear Regression algorithm.
Few steps are involved in the understanding the algorithm: 
1. We should understand problem statement and the dataset in the training.
2. The problem statement is that we have a
